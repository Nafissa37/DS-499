# Exploring Pittsburgh’s Urban Forest Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project investigates the value and condition of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania’s urban forest using machine learning models and data science techniques. The dataset, obtained from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-trees), contains detailed information about trees maintained by the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works Forestry Division. Refer to the dataset README for additional information on the dataset. 

The primary objectives of this research include:

- **Develop Predictive Models for Tree Benefits**
  - Implement **decision trees and random forests** to predict tree benefits based on species, size, and location.  

- **Identify Opportunities for Urban Greening** 
  - Determine which parts of Pittsburgh could **benefit from additional tree planting** based on environmental impact analysis.  

- **Improve Data Science and Machine Learning Skills**
  - Apply **data wrangling, feature engineering, model validation, and performance measurement** techniques to derive meaningful takeaways from the dataset.
